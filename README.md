# Custom Create modpack (title tbd)

GitHub repository structure is intended for use with the Prism Launcher.


As best as I can tell, the least obnoxious way.
  - Drag zip file in, create modpack instance in folder Create
  - git clone git@github.com:omgimanerd/create-modpack tmp/
  - mv tmp/.git Create
  - rm -rf tmp/
  - cd Create/
  - git checkout .
